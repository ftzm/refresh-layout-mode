* Refresh Layout Mode
refresh-layout.el provides a minor mode which automatically refreshes
the window layout when windows are created or destroyed.  It extends rotate.el.
** Installation
I recommend installing the library with use-package and straight.el:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package refresh-layout
  :straight (refresh-layout
	     :type git
	     :host github
	     :repo "ftzm/refresh-layout-mode" )
  :config
  (refresh-layout-mode))
#+END_SRC
** Configuration
The default window layout function is the custom `rotate:3column-right-bias`, which will split the frame into up to 3 columns, and accommodates further windows with vertical splits starting from the right-hand side. It is also possible to set the layout to other functions such as those defined in rotate.el as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq rotate-current-layout 'rotate:horizontally-n)
#+END_SRC
Be sure to use the functions which take a ~num~ argument.
